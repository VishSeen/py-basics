# Naming Variables 
# --------------- #

# variables should be named well so that we
# can understand what they hold.
# it should be as descriptive as possible.
# just make sure not to write too long variable names
# if a variable name contains many words
# it is better to use _ (underscore) to separate
# the words. 
# make sure to use only words / letters to name variables
# Ex can be found below

a_white_car_text = "This is a white car" # use underscore to separate words


# as it may seems good and descriptive, the above variable name
# is long and TOO descriptive.
# what we can do is as name it as simple as possible while making
# sure we understand what it holds.
# it can be written as this :
white_car = "This is a white car"
