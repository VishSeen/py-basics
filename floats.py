# Floats variable
# ----------------- #

# floats are decimal numbers.
# whenever you need to display 


# To create a float variable
# first: give it a name
# sec : use the = (equal sign) to assign a value
# third : enter your decimal number
# ------------------- #
# a_num = your value  #
# ------------------- #

a_float = 0.0002
pi = 3.14
human_temp = 37.0



# Outputs
# ---------------------- #
print(a_float)
print(pi)
print(human_temp)
print("--------------")



# Manipulating variable
# ---------------------- #
# we can use some functions on floats just like any other variable.
# int() converts float inside ( ) to integer
# float() converts integer inside ( ) to float

# creating a float
total_people = 25.5

# creating a variable to store integer of total_people.
# with the use of int() we converted total_people to integer
# and stored that in round_up variable.
# so the round_up variable contains an integer value as 
# it was converted.
round_up = int(total_people)
print(round_up)
